echo "This update modifies the authentication process to work in two ways:"
echo ""
echo "1. Direct Environment Variable Check:"
echo "   - If username matches ADMIN_USERNAME (defaults to 'admin')"
echo "   - AND password matches ADMIN_PASSWORD"
echo "   - Login is granted immediately with admin rights"
echo "   - No need to update database or run additional scripts"
echo ""
echo "2. Standard Database Check (for normal users):"
echo "   - Regular users continue to authenticate normally"
echo "   - Passwords are checked against database values"
echo ""
echo "After deploying, you should be able to log in immediately with:"
echo "- Username: admin (or value from ADMIN_USERNAME)"
echo "- Password: [value from ADMIN_PASSWORD]"
echo ""
echo "Additional troubleshooting tips:"
echo "- Clear your browser cookies and cache before testing"
echo "- Double-check that both environment variables are set correctly"
echo "- If needed, the auth-diagnostic.cjs script can still be used for diagnostics"
