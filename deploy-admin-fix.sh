echo "- Update the admin password if UPDATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=true"
echo ""
echo "After running the script, you should be able to log in with:"
echo "- Username: admin"
echo "- Password: [value from ADMIN_PASSWORD]"

echo "Additional troubleshooting tips:"
echo "- If login still fails, try running: node hash-password.cjs YourPassword"
echo "  Then set ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH to the generated hash value"
echo "- Clear your browser cookies and cache before testing the login again"
